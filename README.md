Basic Data Analytics for Hacker News Posts

This is a simple program based on the guided project at Dataquest. Here, I analyze a dataset of Hacker News posts from September 2015-16. The documentation for it can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts

Hacker News has 2 specific types of posts called Ask HN and Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

The goals of the project are simple:

1. Which of the two, Ask HN or Show HN, has the higher number of average comments?
2. Among the posts that have the higher average, does the time of posting affect the number of comments? If yes, what are the top 5 hours that recieve the most comments?
